    Number used as AND/OR logics:                1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,172 out of   9,112   23%
    Number used as logic:                    2,170 out of   9,112   23%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,043
      Number using O5 output only:              41
      Number using O5 and O6:                   86
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       152 out of   4,556    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,173
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,168 out of   2,173   53%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   1 out of   2,173    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,004 out of   2,173   46%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              12 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
